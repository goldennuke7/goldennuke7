- 👋 Hi, I’m @goldennuke7
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about code in general! I'm a total newbie who's currently interested in web development, but later wants to work on graphics rendering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code at all.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects that will be given to me by The Odin Project.
- 📫 How to reach me: zvyvibin#9555 on discord.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I actually want to code as a side hustle so I can sustain my acting/directing career.
<!--So this is hidden... nice!
